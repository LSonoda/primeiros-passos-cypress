# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate tests for the login functionality and the user update feature. Cypress is a JavaScript-based framework for end-to-end testing that enables developers to write and run tests directly in a real browser environment.

```
> **NOTE:**
> 
> it is necessary to have **node** installed

## Running

# You open the cypress UI

```
